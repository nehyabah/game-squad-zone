## Leaderboard Rankings

### How Rankings Work
1. **Win Percentage** (Primary)
   - Formula: `(Wins + Pushes/2) / Total Games × 100`
   - Pushes count as 0.5 wins

2. **Total Points** (Tie-Breaker)
   - If two users have same win %, higher points ranks first

### Example Standings
```
Rank | Player | Record    | Win %  | Points
-----|--------|-----------|--------|-------
1    | Alice  | 8-2-0     | 80.0%  | 80
2    | Bob    | 7-2-1     | 75.0%  | 70
3    | Carol  | 6-3-1     | 65.0%  | 60
```

**Why Bob ranks #2:**
- Bob: (7 + 1/2) / 10 = 75%
- Carol: (6 + 1/2) / 10 = 65%

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Spread** | Points added/subtracted from team's score |
| **Cover** | Beat the spread (win your bet) |
| **Favorite** | Team expected to win (negative spread) |
| **Underdog** | Team expected to lose (positive spread) |
| **Push** | Tie after spread applied (rare) |
| **Pick 'Em** | No spread (0.0), just pick winner |
| **Line** | Another term for spread |
| **Lock** | A pick you're confident will win |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Confusing spread with expected score**
- Spread is about margin of victory, not final score

❌ **Forgetting negative spreads mean winning by MORE**
- Chiefs -7.5 means they must win by 8+, not 7

❌ **Thinking underdogs must win**
- Underdogs can cover by losing within the spread

❌ **Picking all favorites**
- Favorites don't always cover; diversify your picks

❌ **Ignoring push possibility**
- Whole number spreads (7.0, 3.0) can push

## Quick Math Check

### To Check If Your Pick Won:
1. Find your team's actual score
2. Add the spread to it
3. Compare to opponent's score
4. If higher → You Win! ✅
5. If lower → You Lose ❌
6. If equal → Push 🔄

### Example Calculation:
```
You picked: Patriots +3.5
Final: Bills 20, Patriots 17

Step 1: Patriots scored 17
Step 2: 17 + 3.5 = 20.5
Step 3: 20.5 vs Bills' 20
Step 4: 20.5 > 20 → You WIN! ✅
```
